# Assignment-2
## Task 1
* The program uses an if-else statement to determine if the number is even or odd.
* The condition used is x % 2 == 0 to check for even number.
* If the condition is True, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.
* The program also uses f-strings for clean and readable output formatting.

## Task 2
* A variable sum is initialized to 0 to store the running total.
* A for loop iterates through numbers 1 to 50 using range(1, 51).
* In each iteration, the current number i is added to sum.
* Finally, the result is displayed using a print() statement.
