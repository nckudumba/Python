# Assignment-2
## Task 1 – Factorial Calculation Using Recursion
* The user is prompted to input a number using `input()`.
* A recursive function `factorial()` is defined to calculate the factorial:
  - If the number is less than 2, it returns 1.
  - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-1` and multiplies the result.
* The result is stored in the variable `result`.
* The output is printed using an f-string for clarity and formatting.

## Task 2 – Using Math Module Functions
* The `math` module is imported using `from math import *` to access functions directly.
* The user inputs a number which is stored in variable `n`.
* Three mathematical operations are performed:
  - `sqrt(n)` calculates the square root.
  - `log(n)` computes the natural logarithm.
  - `sin(n)` returns the sine of the number.
* The results are displayed using the `print()` function with labels.
